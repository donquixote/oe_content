# OpenEuropa Content Redirect Link Field

This module provides a redirect link field that can be used to store External URL for nodes and to which the user will be redirected when trying to access the node.
This field can be used on several corporate content types, so it is packaged in its own, independent, module.

## Usage

* Enable the module and add instances of the field `oe_redirect_link` to the content type you'd like to enable this functionality on.
* For supporting only external URLs you have to select 'External links only' allowed link type in field settings.
