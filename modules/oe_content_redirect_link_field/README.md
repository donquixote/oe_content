# OpenEuropa Content Redirect Link Field

This module provides the storage configuration for a redirect link field. A redirect link field is a Link field
that can be used to store External URL for nodes. This field can be used on several corporate
content types, so it is packaged in its own, independent, module.

## Usage

By enabling this module you just get the possibility to add translatable text field named
`oe_redirect_link`.
For supporting only external URLs you have to select 'External links only' allowed link type in field settings.
