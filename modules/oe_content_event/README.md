## Installation

Before enabling this module, make sure that the following modules are present in your codebase by adding them to your
`composer.json` and by running `composer update`:

```json

    "drupal/typed_link": "~1.1",

}
```

The `field_group` module requires the following patches to be applied:

        "https://www.drupal.org/project/field_group/issues/2787179#comment-13467953": "https://www.drupal.org/files/issues/2020-02-17/2787179-highlight-html5-validation-45.patch"
    }
}
```

In order to apply the patches above add the following to your project's `composer.json` file:

```json
"require": {
    "cweagans/composer-patches": "^1.6"
},
"extra": {
    "enable-patching": true
}
```

## Link List integration

This module provides integration with the OpenEuropa Link List component in the form of a custom Link Source Filter
plugin that allows to filter Event link lists based on their start and end dates.
To ensure proper cacheability, this plugin depends on the `openeuropa/oe_time_caching` component so make sure you
require it in your composer.json file.
